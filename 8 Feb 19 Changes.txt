OMtools change log:

8 Feb 2019:
cleaned up grapcopy code, added optional output to destination axis window.

7 Feb 2019:
updated findwind to allow selection between searching Name and Tag fields.

6 Feb 2019:
updated nafx_act and nafx_gui to handle change in name of "EM Data Manager"
window to "EM Data"

5 Feb 2019:
fixed edf2bin to not panic if sample frequency string (e.g."500") appears
elsewhere in the message string being interpreted (most likely due to that
"500" appearing in the time stamp of the message).

Restored edf2bin ability (via user prompt) to concatenate sub-records in
a multi-record EDF file.
